            <p>You are singing daily day, daily guru. Now, today is guru-pūrṇimā. Especially we should understand what is the power of attorney. Anyone can recite this verse, śrī-guru-caraṇa?

                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma, kevala-bhakti-sadma, vando mui sāvadhāna mate.
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Sāvadhāna mate. So this is the beginning, that if you want to be devotee, then you must approach the spiritual master who has got the power. Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma, kevala-bhakti-sadma, vando mui sāvadhāna mate. Sāvadhāna means very carefully, not whimsically. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Yāṅhāra prasāde bhāi...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Yāṅhāra prasāde bhai, ei bhava toriyā yāi. Huh? Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoy yāhā hoite. So why one should go to spiritual master? Because yāṅhāra prasāde bhāi: "My dear brother, if you get the benediction from the spiritual master...," yāṅhāra prasāde bhāi, ei bhava toriyā yāi. What is that benediction? The benediction is not that "Cure my disease." They do not know, generally; therefore they are cheated. The other day in Washington, one lady came with backache. So she came for curing the leg trouble. [laughter] That is going on. "Why you should approach a spiritual master? There is so many doctors, hospital. You go there." "No. Here you show me your miracles." And people are also cheating like that---some miracles, and he becomes God. This is going on. But the miracle of spiritual master is yāṅhāra prasāde bhāi, ei bhava toriyā yāi. This is miracle = no more material existence. Then ei bhava toriyā yāi. So real life means one can cross over the ocean of nescience. That is real gain. That is the real favor of spiritual master, not that cure your leg and again walk here and again become, break your leg, and again come. Not like that. Ei bhava toriyā yāi. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoy yāhā...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoy yāhā haite. That is spiritual master = one who can give you Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa se tomāre, kṛṣṇa dite pāra, dhāi tava pāche pāche---Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. "Kṛṣṇa... I am seeking after Kṛṣṇa, Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura, my spiritual master. So Kṛṣṇa is your property." Kṛṣṇa is not independent. He is the property of the devotee. Kṛṣṇa se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dite pāra, dhāi tava pāche pāche: "I am just following you, sir. Because Kṛṣṇa is your property, if you like, you can deliver = 'Take it immediately.' " So it is not flattering; it is in the śāstra. Vedeṣu durlabha adurlabha ātmā-bhaktau [Bs. 5.33]. You cannot get Kṛṣṇa by studying all the Vedas. Vedeṣu durlabha. Durlabha means it is not possible. Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi jānāti tattvam [SB 10.14.29]. Prasāda-leśa. Prasāda-leśa, one who has got little favor of Kṛṣṇa, he knows Kṛṣṇa-tattva. Yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ gauram eva stumaḥ [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 5].
                
                Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī, he has made one poetry, kaivalyaṁ narakāyate [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 5]. Kaivalya means to merge into the Brahman existence---no difference; oneness. That is called kaivalya. So for a Vaiṣṇava this kaivalya is as good as the hell. Prabodānanda Sarasvatī says, kaivalyaṁ narakāyate. This kaivalya... No Vaiṣṇava will say, "Now I am going to merge into the existence," no, because they hate it as hell. Kaivalyam narakāyate. Then? Heavenly planets? Tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate. Tridaśa-pūr means the heaven, where so many millions of demigods live. They consider, Vaiṣṇava consider, as ākāśa-puṣpa, will o' the wisp, phantasmagoria. It has no value. Ākāśa-puṣpāyate. That means karmī, jñānī. Jñānīs, they are after liberation, merging into the existence, Brahman existence, kaivalya. The Vaiṣṇava says, "Oh, this achievement is as good as one who goes to the hell." Then? Heavenly planet? Karmīs, they might have pious activities. They want to go to the heavenly planet. So Vaiṣṇava says that "What is this heavenly planet? It is phantasmagoria only. It has no..." Actually it is so. Then yogī? The yogī's main business is to control the senses. That is real yoga. Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ. Controlling the senses so that mind can be in a peaceful condition... Without controlling your senses, mind cannot be. Then you can apply this mind for meditation. If the mind is agitated, what is this nonsense meditation? First of all control the mind; then think of meditation. Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā. We have to meditate with the mind. But if the mind is agitated, where is the question of meditation? It is all bogus. So for a yogī the first business is yama-niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, dhyāna, dhāraṇā, pratyāhāra-aṣṭa, aṣṭāṅga-yoga. Then one's mind is controlled. Then dhyānāvasthita. Then he can remain in trance, always thinking of Viṣṇu. That is yoga. So first thing is to control the mind, control the senses.
                
                So that is also, I mean to say, declined by the devotee. He says that durdānta indriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 5]. The senses are just like venomous serpent, always agitating. And as soon as one sense touches another sense, then finish, spiritual life finished. Just like the serpent, if he touches even little, immediately your life is finished, similarly, our senses are very strong, just like as strong as the serpent, uncontrollable. So why it is so dangerous? Because it has got the fang. He has got fang, poison. But there are physicians, in the Āyurvedic physician, they know. They capture snakes and they take away the fang for making medicine. They are also used as medicine. So if the poison teeth is broken, then it is no more dangerous, no more dangerous. It may have very big hood, but one knows that his poison teeth is taken away, he is not afraid. It may be very fearful to the children, but a grown-up man who knows that his poison teeth is no longer there, he is not afraid. In Bengal he is called viṣṇai kulama cakra[?] = "There is no poison, and you have got a very big hood."
                
                So how it is possible? First thing is kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate, and durdānta indriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta daṁṣṭrāyate. How it is possible? Now, viśvaṁ sukhāyate. This material is miserable for everyone. For a devotee it is not at all miserable. Sukhāyate. In this New York City there are so many skyscraper building. Bring all of them and compare our happiness. See practically. Here is a skyscraper building, and there are others. And call them and ask them, "Are you happy like us?" So we can turn this whole world like that. Viśvaṁ pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate. It is possible. Everyone is hankering, working so hard day and night, and there is fire brigade, gon-gon-gon-gon it is going on. [laughter] This is that life. But that is not happiness. Here is happiness. Come here, sit down, and you'll find happiness. It is practical. So if you expand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, you'll find whole world full of happiness. Viṣvaṁ pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate. Now how it is possible? Yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ gauram eva stumaḥ. It is possible simply by the mercy glance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If He simply glances over anybody, then the whole thing happens.
                
                So Caitanya Mahāprabhu is giving, empowering Sanātana Gosvāmī. So we should follow. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, ei chai gosāi yār, tāro mui dās: "I am servant of that person who has followed the six Gosvāmīs."
                
                ei chai gosāi yār, tāro mui dās
                tān sabāra pada-reṇu, mora pañca-grās
                Narottama dāsa says, "By... Their dust of lotus feet is my subsistence." So today Sanātana Gosvāmī's birthday? Disappearance. Disappearance and appearance the same. His disappearance here, appearance somewhere. Just like sunset, sunrise, immediately. Sunset and sunrise, simultaneously. So for a Vaiṣṇava, because he is under the order of Kṛṣṇa, he appears somewhere and disappears somewhere because he is order-carrier. He says, "Now go there. Preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Go there." So appearance here, disappearance there. Therefore the same thing. Then what is the next line?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Guru-mukha-padma-vākya....
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Cittete kariyā aikya. Now this is the determination. We must approach the real guru, empowered guru, with power of attorney. Then if we take his word... Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete kariyā, āra nā kariyā mane.... Don't try, don't manufacture ideas. Then if you take up that seriously, then your life is successful. Guru-mukha-padma, cittete, āra nā kariyā mane. Don't spoil yourself by manufacturing ideas. Take word from him. You carry it out. Don't bother whether you'll be spiritually advanced or not, but take the word of the spiritual master and carry it. Then everything guaranteed. Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, āra nā koriyā mane āśā. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Śrī-guru-caraṇe rati...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Śrī-guru-carane rati, sei uttama-gati. You want advancement in spiritual consciousness, but it is possible only śrī-guru-caraṇe rati. If you keep your faith only on the lotus feet of your guru, then you'll make advance. There is no doubt about it. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Ye prasāde pūre sarva āśā.
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Ye prasāde pūre. We have got so many desires, but if we have got strong faith at the lotus feet of guru, everything will be fulfilled automatically. Ye prasāde pūre sarva āśā. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Cakhudāna dilo yei...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Cakhudāna dilo yei, janme janme prabhu sei. Guru's business is cakhudāna. We are kept in the darkness of this material existence, and guru's business is to open it, bring him to the light. That is guru, not to keep him again in the darkness. Cakhudāna dila yei janma janma prabhu sei. Prabhu means master. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Divya-jñāna hṛde prokāśito.
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Divya-jñāna hṛde prokāśito. What is that divya-jñāna? Divya-jñāna is that we are all servant of Kṛṣṇa, and our only business is to serve Kṛṣṇa. Divya-jñāna. This is divya-jñāna. It is not difficult at all. Simply we have... We have become servant of so many things---servant of society, servant of community, servant of country, servant of wife, servant of children, servant of dog and so many. "Now let me become servant of Kṛṣṇa." This is divya-jñāna. Dīkṣā. Dīkṣā means from this divya-jñāna. That is dī. And kṣā means kṣapayati, "expands." Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Prema-bhakti yāhā hoite....
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Prema bhakti yāhā hoite, avidyā vināśa yāte.
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Vede gāy yāṅhāra...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Vede gāy yāṅhāra carito. You should understand this. So by the mercy of guru, by the favor of guru, we get prema-bhakti. There are vidhi-bhakti. In the beginning we have to discharge devotional service according to the rules and regulations of the śāstra, the instruction of guru, śāstra-vidhi. Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na siddhim avāpnoti [Bg. 16.23]. Kṛṣṇa says, "This śāstra-vidhim, the vidhi-mārga, if one gives up the śāstra-vidhi and manufactures his own way," na siddhiṁ sāvāpnoti, "he does not get success," na sukham, "neither happiness," na parāṁ gatim, "and what to speak of going back to home, back to Godhead?" Forget all this. Śāstra-vidhi. So this is vidhi-mārga. So when we are practiced to vidhi-mārga, then we gradually get love of Godhead. That is ultimate. Premā pumartho mahān. Just like in India formerly they... Very small, minor-aged boy and girl are married, especially the girl, ten, twelve years, married. So how she can love her husband? She does not know. But there is vidhi-mārga. Vidhi-mārga, the elderly people of the..., "Now, just to give your husband this refreshment." So she gives. In this way, gradually, when she's grown-up, she does not require any instruction; she knows how to serve her husband. That is prema. That is the bha... But the beginning must be regulative principle. Prema, vidhi prema. Prema-bhakti yāhā hoite, avidyā vināśa yāte. Prema-bhakti, avidyā... Unless we are freed from this nescience of material existence, there is no question of Kṛṣṇa prema. Two things cannot go. Viraktir anyatra syāt. If you actually advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then naturally you'll be averse to this material enjoyment. Viraktir... Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt [SB 11.2.42]. Just like if you are eating, naturally you are satisfying your appetite. So kṛṣṇa-bhakti means we are satisfying automatically all our desires. That is kṛṣṇa-bhakti. The more we advance in kṛṣṇa-bhakti, you'll have no more material desires. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Śrī-guru kāruṇa-sindhu...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Śrī-guru kāruṇa-sindhu, adhama janāra bandhu. Then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Lokanātha lokera jīvana.
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Lokanātha lokera jīvana. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's guru's name was Lokanātha Gosvāmī. You have seen, those who have gone to Vṛndāvana, there is Lokanatha Gosvāmī's tomb. So, then?
                
                <br><br>Dhṛṣṭadyumna: Hā hā prabhu koro dayā...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Hā hā prabhu koro dayā. Hā hā prabhu koro dayā...
                
                <br><br>Devotees: ...deho more pada-chāyā.
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: So this the our... We should seek the shelter of the lotus feet of guru. Then everything... And vede gāya yāṅhāra carita. It is not that it is sentiment that one has to become very staunch devotee of guru. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, vede gāya yāṅhāra carita. Not that I am talking something nonsense. It is because... Śruti-pramāṇam. Whatever we talk, it must be supported by Vedic injunction. Then it is right. Just like we sometimes challenge these big, big scientists and others, and what is our strength? I am not a scientist, but how I can challenge? The vede gāya: we have got evidence from the Vedas. Just like so many people are thinking that the moon planet is first. We are challenging, "No, moon planet is second." What is the strength? The strength is Vedic knowledge. We cannot accept it. So vede gāya yāṅhāra carita. Vedic knowledge is so perfect that you can challenge so many scientists. If it is not in accordance to the Vedic knowledge, then it is... We do not accept. If it is not to the Kṛṣṇa's instruction, we reject immediately. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. 7.15]. As soon as we see that one man is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, then we immediately group him in four classes = duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā. Finished, that's all. "No, I am learned, and you are nothing. You have not... You have no degrees of university. I have got degrees." "Yes, that is all right, but your degrees and knowledge have been taken away by māyā. You remain in darkness. Yei timire jeti[?]. You remain in the darkness." That's all.</p>

    <p>Prabhupāda: Yes. This is the order. Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya. Now, citta means consciousness, or heart. "I shall do this only, bās. My Guru Mahārāja told me; I shall do this." Cittete koriyā aikya, ār nā koriho mane āśā. So it is not my pride, but I can say, for your instruction, I did it. Therefore whatever little success you see than my all my Godbrothers, it is due to this. I have no capacity, but I took it, the words of my guru, as life and soul. So this is fact. Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya. Everyone should do that. But if he makes addition, alteration, then he is finished. No addition, alteration. You have to approach guru---guru means the faithful servant of God, Kṛṣṇa---and take his word how to serve Him. Then you are successful. If you concoct, "I am very intelligent than my guru, and I can make addition or alteration," then you are finished. So that is the only. And now, sing further.
<br>
<br>
        Devotee: Śrī-guru-caraṇe rati, ei se uttama-gati.
 <br>
 <br>       
        Prabhupāda: Śrī-guru-caraṇe rati, ei se, uttama-gati. If you want to make real progress, then you must be firmly faithful at the lotus feet of guru. Then?
        <br><br>
        Devotee: Je prasāde pūre sarva āśā.
        <br><br>
        Prabhupāda: Je prasāde pūre sarva āśā. Yasya prasādāt... This is the instruction in the whole Vaiṣṇava philosophy. So unless we do that, we remain mūḍha, and this is explained in this Ajāmila upākhyāna. So today we are reading this verse, sa evaṁ vartamānaḥ ajñaḥ. </p>

        <p>But we are reading ten kinds of offenses, gurvaṣṭaka, and the guru’s... Do you know the meaning, what is that, śrī-guru-carana-padma? What is that song? Read it.

            <br><br>Prabhupada: Ah, sāvadhāna mate, "with great care." You sing this song---do you know the meanings? No. Who can explain the meaning? Yes, you explain.
            <br><br>Devotee: Śrī-guru-carana-padma means "the lotus feet of the guru." Kevala bhakati-sadma, that he is a reservoir of all devotion, or bhakti. Bando mui sāvadhāna means that we worship him with great awe.
            <br><br>Prabhupada: Hmm. Read. Read the other lines.
            <br><br>Devotee: Jāhāra prasāde bhāi...

            <br><br>Devotee: E bha va toriyā jāi.
            <br><br>Prabhupada: E bha va toriyā jāi. If one is, I mean to say, favored by guru, then the path to cross over the nescience is clear. Jāhāra prasāde bhāi, e bha va toriyā jāi. Then, next line.
            <br><br>Devotee: Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoy jāhā hāte.
            <br><br>Prabhupada: And krṣṇa-prāpti hoy jāhā hate: by the favor of guru one gets Kṛṣṇa. This is the...Yasya prasādād bhagavat. Everywhere. This is bhagavad-bhakti-yoga. So one who has not attained this state, what is this bhagavad-bhakti? This is rascaldom. That is not bhagavad...
            evaṁ prasanna-manaso
            bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ
            [SB 1.2.20]
            Bhagavad-bhakti---yoga. It is a kind of yoga, or the real yoga. Topmost yoga system is bhagavad-bhakti, and bhagavad-bhakti-yoga begins, ādau gurv-āśrayaḥ. First of all surrender to guru.
            tad viddhi praṇipātena
            paripraśnena sevayā
            [Bg. 4.34]
            The official initiation has no meaning. Unless one who has fully surrendered to guru, there is no question of initiation. Divya jñāna hṛde prokāśito. Divya-jñāna means "transcendental knowledge." So to play tricks with guru, to become diplomat and intriguer, these rascaldom will not help bhagavad-bhakti-yoga. You can get some other things, some material profit, but spiritual life will be spoiled.</p>

            <p>I have narrated several times the story of a brāhmaṇa in South India. He was illiterate, and he was reading Bhagavad-gītā. So his friends, village friends, they knew that "This man is illiterate. How he can read Bhagavad-gītā?" So they were criticizing, "Hello, brāhmaṇa. How you are reading Bhagavad-gītā?" So he did not say anything, because he knew that "These friends are criticizing me because I am illiterate. He knows." So when Caitanya Mahāprabhu came there, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was attracted. He was illiterate, and he was reading Bhagavad-gītā, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu was attracted. Just see. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired, "My dear brāhmaṇa, what you are reading?" So he also could understand that "Here is a person who has not come to criticize me. He is serious." "Yes, sir, I am reading Bhagavad-gītā, but I am illiterate. I am illiterate." "Then what you are reading?" "No, I am simply turning the pages. I cannot read anything." "Then why you are reading if you cannot?" "No, my Guru Mahārāja ordered me. My Guru Mahārāja asked me that 'You shall read Bhagavad-gītā daily, eighteen chapters.' " Guru Mahārāja knew him that he is illiterate, but still ordered. This is called guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, ār nā koriho mane āśā. This is called firm faith in guru. Guru ordered him that "You read." Guru must know him, that he is illiterate. So what he will read? Why guru is ordering him? But because he had firm faith in guru, and he was trying to read, Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to see him. Just see how this line is important = guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, ār nā koriho mane āśā. Ār means anything more, you don't try to understand. Whatever your guru says, you just try to carry it out. So what is the next line? Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete...

                <br><br>Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa: Śrī-guru-caraṇe rati...
                
                <br><br>Prabhupāda: Śrī-guru-caraṇe rati, ei se uttama-gati. Don't try to make very good advance by manufacturing your own way. Simply, śrī-guru-caraṇe rati, ei se uttama-gati. That is first-class. That is Vedic instruction. Vede gāy jāṅhāra carito. The Vedas says,
                
                yasya deve parā bhaktir
                yathā deve tathā gurau
                tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
                prakāśante mahātmanaḥ
                [ŚU 6.23]
                
                To understand Vedic literature means one must have firm faith in Kṛṣṇa and firm faith in guru, not that "My guru is not so learned, so let me capture Kṛṣṇa directly." That is useless. That is useless. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja [Cc. Madhya 19.151]. One can get the seed of the plant or creeper of bhakti, how? Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpā. By the mercy of guru and by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, not that kṛṣṇa-kṛpā. First guru-kṛpā, then kṛṣṇa-kṛpā. So this brāhmaṇa attracted the attention of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was illiterate, and he could not read even one word. What is the truth in it? The same thing = guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya. He took guru's order very seriously, that "My Guru Mahārāja has ordered me, and I must carry out. Never mind I cannot read. Let me open the pages and see. That's all." So he was doing that.</p>

    <p>Don't try to cheat Kṛṣṇa. Don't try to cheat guru. Don't try to cheat Kṛṣṇa. Then your progress is sure. Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja [Cc. Madhya 19.151]. You are singing daily, śrī-guru-caraṇa... What is that? Śrī-guru...

        <br><br>Devotees: Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma, kevala-bhakati-sadma.
        
        <br><br>Prabhupāda: No, that...
        
        <br><br>Devotee: Guru-mukha?
        
        <br><br>Prabhupāda: Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya. Don't try to cheat guru. Then progress will be checked.
        
        ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān
        nāvamanyeta karhicit
        na martya-buddhyāsūyeta
        sarva-devamayo guruḥ
        [SB 11.17.27]
        
        Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān. Kṛṣṇa says, "Ācārya means I am." Nāvamanyeta karhicit: "Do not try to neglect." Na martya-buddhyāsūyeta: "Do not consider ācārya, spiritual master, as ordinary human being and become envious." These things are warned. Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit, na martya-buddhyāsūyeta. Familiarity breeds contempt. That is not good. Similarly... Because by the mercy of ācārya, by the mercy of guru, you will get Kṛṣṇa. You sing that, kṛṣṇa-prāpti jāhā hoite, what is that?
        
        <br><br>Devotee: Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoiya jānā.
        
        <br><br>Prabhupāda: Kṛṣṇa-prāpti jāhā hoite. What is that language?
        
        Kṛta-kṛta: That by his mercy he brings us close to Kṛṣṇa.
        
        <br><br>Prabhupāda: No, no, what is that Bengali language? You cannot... You are singing daily?
        
        Kṛta-kṛta: Prema-bhakti jāhā hoite, avidyā vināśa jāte.
        
        <br><br>Prabhupāda: Ah. Avidyā vināśa jāte, kṛṣṇa-prāpti haya... So these are the things. Avidyā vināśa jāte. Avidyā means ignorance. We are full of ignorance. So guru's duty is to open the eyes, and by opening your eyes he will give you Kṛṣṇa. So this is the process. So you should be very much careful not to cheat Kṛṣṇa, not to cheat guru, and become very sincere and follow. Then it is guaranteed. Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja [Cc. Madhya 19.151]. Two things required. You cannot jump over Kṛṣṇa, neglecting guru. Then it is finished. If you want to jump over Kṛṣṇa without favor of the guru... Kṛṣṇa is not so easy. So these things should be very carefully observed. No offense. Sincerely follow. Then Kṛṣṇa will protect, and your progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to go back to home, back to Godhead, will be assured, insured.
        
        So this man circumstantially fell down. So Kṛṣṇa is saving him. Kṛṣṇa is saving him, and he will be saved. We shall see in the following passage.
        
        Thank you very much.</p>
